        <h3>Working with Vicki was the best decision and investment I have made in my career thus far. I have big plans and big dreams about where I should be headed but didnâ€™t know how to put years of experience and skills to help me get there. Her Personal Brand Power Jam helped clarify the strengths I have, but also put it in a concise package that made sense to me and my future employers.</h3>
